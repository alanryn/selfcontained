We create green solutions for:

* Container plantings  
* Small gardens  
* Indoor green spaces  

We offer an urban gardening sevice that includes design, installation, maintenance, advice and consultation  
Convert your drab urban space into a green oasis.  

**It's easy when you do it right, we will show you how.**
