Simple Hydroponic Garden

Hydroponics is the cultivation of plants by placing the roots in liquid nutrient solutions rather than in soil. Here’s a simple homemade option.

Ingredients

* 1 large opaque container (it’s important that no light can get to the water)  
* 1 lid big enough to cover top of large the container (it can be strong cardboard, wood, plastic, polystyrene—again it must not let light through).  
* 1 shallow container with length and width slightly less than larger container.  
* 1 water pump with a short length of tubing.  
* small plastic net pots ([here’s the real thing](https://www.amazon.com/Inch-Net-Pots-Cups-Hydroponics/dp/B005AV9QQS), but you can improvise and make your own with plastic cups or pieces of net).  
* liquid nutrient to add to water.  
* supports for small container.  
* growing medium – coconut husk (to germinate seeds) and an inert medium, such as clay pellets, perlite or gravel.  
* seeds  

Method

**Step 1**: Add a seed to a moist piece of coconut husk (or cotton wool). Allow the seed to germinate and grow into a small seedling

**Step 2**: Make holes in the lid – big enough to fit the plastic cups. The number of holes depends on the size of the lid, the diagram shows ten. If you use cardboard this can be done with a scissors or knife; otherwise, the easiest method is to use a drill.

**Step 3**: The inner container needs to be supported above the water level and with its edge just below the lid of the larger container. Here you may need to improvise to find a support with the correct height.

**Step 4**: Place the water pump on bottom of larger container; attach one end of tube to the pump and place the other end inside the smaller container (make a hole in the lid to allow the pump’s power cable to enter).

**Step 5**: Add enough water to almost reach the level of the bottom of the inner container; add the recommended amount of liquid nutrient to the water (follow manufacturer’s instructions).

**Step 6**: Place lid on the larger container; place plastic cups in holes; add your seedling contained in the coconut fiber, with some clay pellets, to a cup; add one seedling to each cup; the roots will dangle through the bottom of the cup and into the water below.

**Step 7**: Turn on the pump; the nutrient rich water is pushed from the large container to the smaller inner container feeding the roots of the plants. When this container fills with water it will pour over the edge and back into the larger container.

**Step 8**: Watch your plants grow; it should be much faster than growing in soil; keep in a sunny place (depending on the requirements of the plants) and top up the water nutrients if required.
