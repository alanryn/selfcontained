Mycorrhizas are the fungal associations that form between plant roots and beneficial fungi in the soil. They enable plants to obtain nutrients through a bi-directional exchange&mdash;carbon from plant to the fungus, and soil nutrients, mainly phosporous and nitrogen, from the fungus to plant. Mushrooms are only the fruiting bodies of fungi: beneath the surface is a vast mycelial network. The term mycorrhizal comes from the Greek words mykes, meaning fungus, and rhiza, meaning root. 


Human interference tends to destroy mycorrhizal fungi; this reduces the ability of plants to thrive in garden type environments; we then resort to fertilizers and other artificial methods to promote plant growth. But it is possible to re-introduce mycorrhizal fungi to the soil, reducing the need for fertilizers. With advancements in research the application of mycorrhizas to the ground is now easy and inexpensive. Mycorrhizal fungi can also be commercially produced and around eight types are currently available. Certain mycorrhizal fungus spores have been identified for their establishment and growth-enhancing abilities. The goal is to create physical contact between the mycorrhizae and the plant root. Mycorrhizal inoculant can be sprinkled onto roots during transplanting, worked into seed beds, blended into potting soil, watered in via existing irrigation systems, applied as a root dip gel or probed into the root zone of existing plants. 


Under natural conditions plants live in close association with the mycorrhizal fungi. They colonize plant roots and extend the root system into the surrounding soil. Nearly all plants form mycorrhizae and require this association to flourish. Plants divert the majority of their energy to below-ground processes. While some of this energy goes into root growth, a high proportion may be used to feed mycorrhizal fungi and other soil organisms. The relationship between fungus and root is critical. Issues, such as, soil compaction, top soil loss, and the absence of quality organic matter, reduce the habitat necessary for the mycorrhizal fungus to survive and thrive. Artificial landscapes isolate the plant from beneficial mycorrhizal fungi available in natural settings and thereby increase plant stress and the need for water, nutrients, and soil structure normally provided by the subterrenean fungi. 


Mycorrhizal fungi release powerful chemicals into the soil that dissolve hard to capture nutrients such as phosphorous and iron. In non mycorrhizal conditions fertility is wasted or lost from the system. Disease and pathogen suppression is another benefit for a mycorrhizal plant. Mycorrhizal roots have a cover that acts as a physical barrier against the invasion of root diseases. In addition, mycorrhizal fungi attack pathogen or disease organisms entering the root zone. Mycorrhizal fungi also improve soil structure. Nursery grown plants are often deficient in mycorrhizae. Plants raised in most nurseries receive intensive care and feeding which discourages the plant from producing the extensive root system it will need for successful transplantation. Application of mycorrhizal inoculum during transplanting can encourage plant establishment and set the plant on track to feed for itself. Reintroducing mycorrhizal fungi in areas where they have been depleted can dramatically improve plant establishment and growth.


Mycorrhizal diversity is important. Natural areas generally contain an array of mycorrhizal fungal species. The proportions and abundance of mycorrhizal species often shifts following any disturbance. Not all mycorrhizal fungi have the same capacities and tolerances. Some are better at imparting drought resistance while others may be more effective in protecting against pathogens or have more tolerance to soil temperature extremes. Because of the wide variety of soil, climatic, and biotic conditions characterizing man-made environments, it is improbable that a single mycorrhizal fungus could benefit all host species and adapt to all conditions. For example, the types and activities of mycorrhizal fungi associated with young plants may be quite different from those associated with mature plants Likewise, mycorrhizal fungi needed to help seedlings establish themselves on difficult sites may differ from those which sustain productivity over a long-lived plant.
