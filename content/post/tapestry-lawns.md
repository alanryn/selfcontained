Tapestry lawns are grass-free lawns. By excluding grasses, other suitable plant can be used to produce an alternative to conventional monoculture turf lawns. Tapestry lawns produce more flowers, contain more life, and attract many pollinators. They require little mowing, absorb rain and need no fertilisers. Grass-free tapestry lawns use specific mowing tolerant plants instead of grass. They provide a source of nectar and pollen for more species of pollinators than grass lawns and commercial ‘flower lawns’. Native and mixed origin species tapestry lawns contain significantly more insect life than turf lawns, providing resources for insect eating predators such as birds and small mammals. Plants can be selected for flowers, foliage, scent and novelty. There is an immediate increase in plant diversity when replacing a monoculture type turf lawn. Moss is very rarely found in grass-free lawns. No need for moss killer.

A tapestry lawn is not designed for frequent footfall but it can be walked on. Occasional footfall has been seen to be beneficial, acting to press down plants so that they maintain contact with the soil and helps control growth. It also releases fragrance from scented foliage.
Tapestry lawns are perennial and do not need to be replaced every year like bedding plants.Tapestry lawns are more drought tolerant, and can remain greener for longer. Tapestry lawns have been found to absorb rainfall up to twice as fast as common turf lawns and up to three times faster than bare soil. Tapestry lawns are not static features. The internal structuring continually and visibly changes with the years and seasons. It is possible to add and remove plants as required to change your lawn's appearance.

Tapestry lawns require the regular removal of grasses to keep them as grass-free as possible. Like any living and constantly changing garden plant community, tapestry lawns benefit from a little on-going care (lawn gardening) to keep them looking good and species rich.
